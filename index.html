<h3>Question often asked</h3>
<h4>What do the numbers on the hat signify?</h4>
<p>The card is a price tag in ‘old’ English money: pounds, shillings and pennies, which was then written as l/s/d.</p>

<p>Lewis Carroll has explained the meaning of the tag in his <b>‘Nursery Alice‘</b>:</p>

<center><p><i>The Hatter used to carry about hats to sell: and even the one that he’s got on his head is meant to be sold. You see it’s got its price marked on it – a “10” and a “6” – that means “ten shillings and sixpence.”</i></p></center>

<p>Ten shillings and six pennies (expressed in conversation as “Ten-and-Six”) was quite a large sum in the mid-1800’s.</p>

<p>Chris Somerville amplificated:</p>

<p>The actual <strong>amount</strong> was significant also. Professional people (doctors, lawyers, architects etc) all charged fees, not in pounds but in guineas. One guinea was one pound plus one shilling. And while pounds were the currency of trade, guineas were the currency of the professions. We used to have a gold coin called, and valued at a guinea, and a smaller gold coin, a half guinea, valued at ten and six (10/6).
So the hat worn by the Mad Hatter was <em>priced at half-a-guinea</em>, signifying its <strong>superior style</strong>.</p>
